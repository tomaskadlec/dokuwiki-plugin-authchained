# dokuwiki-plugin-authchained

Authentication plug-in for Dokuwiki that allows delegation of authentication to other configured authentication plug-ins.

## Rationale

This plug-in provides shares the idea and provides similar set of features as [authchained](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:authchained). However, it takes into account that Dokuwiki was not designed with chained authentication concept in mind. The main goal is to provide working authentication in any case which the aforementioned plug-in does not. Support for user management tools (e.g. [usermanager plugin](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:usermanager) is not the main goal and may be limited. Some features may not be available or working. Please read [Known limitations](#known-limitations) below.
